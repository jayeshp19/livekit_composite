## :bulb: LEDs

LEDs are handled similarly to buttons in BSP. The BSP uses the [led_indicator](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/led_indicator) component, which provides simple control over LED states and built-in effects such as blinking, breathing, and more. It also supports addressable RGB LEDs.

```
/* Initialize all LEDs */
bsp_led_indicator_create(leds, NULL, BSP_LED_NUM);

/* Set color of the first LED (for addressable RGB LEDs only) */
led_indicator_set_rgb(leds[0], SET_IRGB(0, 0x00, 0x64, 0x64));

/*
Start a predefined LED effect:
- BSP_LED_ON
- BSP_LED_OFF
- BSP_LED_BLINK_FAST
- BSP_LED_BLINK_SLOW
- BSP_LED_BREATHE_FAST
- BSP_LED_BREATHE_SLOW
*/
led_indicator_start(leds[0], BSP_LED_BREATHE_SLOW);
```

**Notes:**
- `BSP_LED_NUM` defines the total number of available LEDs on the board
- LEDs are automatically configured by the BSP (no need to set GPIO or direction manually)
