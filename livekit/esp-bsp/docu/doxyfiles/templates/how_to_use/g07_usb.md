## :electric_plug: USB

Boards with USB support define macros for USB pins, such as `BSP_USB_POS` and `BSP_USB_NEG`, and may also provide control APIs for enabling or disabling USB functionality.

```
/* Initialize USB in device mode and enable power */
bsp_usb_host_start(BSP_USB_HOST_POWER_MODE_USB_DEV, true);

...
/* Deinitialize and stop USB */
bsp_usb_host_stop();
```

> [!NOTE]
> Not all BSPs implement USB support or provide power control. Refer to the board's documentation and the BSP header files for available functions and supported modes.

For more USB-related APIs and configuration options, check the corresponding BSP header files.
